# A.L.F.R.E.D  
**Automated Limited Functionality Responsive Educational Development (system). or A.L.F.R.E.D.**

A.L.F.R.E.D is a chat-based, responsive, command-structured automation system powered by locally running pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It is designed to function as a background assistant capable of understanding natural language commands and executing system-level actions on Windows.

Name inspired by **Alfred Pennyworth** from *The Dark Knight*.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A.L.F.R.E.D acts as an intelligent automation layer between the user and the operating system.  
It combines LLM inference, speech recognition, system control, and hotkey-based background execution into a single cohesive workflow.

The project runs entirely locally using GGUF-format models via `llama_cpp`, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

- Chat-based command interpretation using local LLMs  
- Background execution with hotkey triggers  
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech support  
- System automation (keyboard, mouse, volume, brightness, media, etc.)  
- Media playback and YouTube downloading  
- Date and time parsing for contextual commands  
- Modular Python-based architecture

## 🚀 Entry Points

- **main.py**  
  The main execution file. Initializes the LLM, handles command parsing, and executes actions.

- **launcher.pyw**  
  Runs in the background as a hotkey listener and launches A.L.F.R.E.D without opening a console window.

## 🤖 Supported LLM Models

The project uses GGUF-format models with `llama_cpp`.
